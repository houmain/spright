**spright** is more than a simple sprite sheet packer, it can be [used as one](#simple-sheet-packing) though. Its key ideas are:

- Keep all the information about the sprites and tiles, required for being efficiently consumable by the game engine, in a plain text file.
- Instead of forcing one to split each sprite in a separate file and later address them using the filename, it should be possible to keep them in whatever format they are most conveniently to handle.
- It should be possible to give each sprite an ID, group them (e.g. for animations) or further annotate them for game specific purposes.
- The tool should be able to deduce obvious information from the input images and assist with completing the required information.

While any text editor can be used for writing the input definition, the [Visual Studio Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=houmain.spright-vscode) can greatly simplify the process.

Also have a look at the [spright test suite](https://github.com/houmain/spright-test-suite) to get an impression of the functionality.

## Simple sheet packing

To pack your sprites into one or more sheets, create an input definition file `spright.conf` like the following and run `spright`:

```perl
max-width 1024                 # set some constraints for the sheet
max-height 1024
power-of-two true

output "spright{0-}.png"
description "spright.json"
  template "phaser.inja"       # select the template for your game engine

id "{{ source.filenameBase }}"
glob "characters/**/*.png"     # set the location of the images you want to pack
glob "scenery/**/*.png"
```

The sample creates a sprite sheet `spright0.png` along the output description `spright.json`, consumable by the [Phaser](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser) game engine. [Templates](#templates) for some other game engines are provided and additional templates can be [easily written](#output-template-engine).

See the [input definition](#input-definition) section for a description of the available options.

## Advanced usage example

Say you got some [nice](https://itch.io/game-assets/tag-sprites) [sprites](https://opengameart.org/art-search-advanced?field_art_type_tid[]=9&sort_by=count) you would like to use in your next game:

| "Decorations (32x32).png" | "Old enemies 2.png" | "misc_scenery.png" | "OrcAttack/Frame01.png" to <br/> "OrcAttack/Frame04.png" |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| <kbd><img src="docs/Decorations (32x32).png"/></kbd> | <img src="docs/Old enemies 2.png"/> | <kbd><img src="docs/misc_scenery.png"/></kbd> | <kbd><img src="docs/Orc Attack/Frame01.png"/></kbd> <kbd><img src="docs/Orc Attack/Frame02.png"/></kbd> <kbd><img src="docs/Orc Attack/Frame03.png"/></kbd> <kbd><img src="docs/Orc Attack/Frame04.png"/></kbd> |

And your game engine supports efficiently packed sprite sheets like this:

<kbd><img src="docs/spright-0.png"/></kbd>

Then you may want to use spright to define the sprites within their original sources and directly pack the sheet from there.

To do so, start by creating a `spright.conf` containing the essential information:

```perl
sheet "sprites"
  padding 1
  output "sheet{0-}.png"

colorkey
crop
crop-pivot

input "Decorations (32x32).png"
  grid 32 32

input "Old enemies 2.png"
  grid 16 16

input "Orc Attack/Frame{01-04}.png"

input "misc_scenery.png"
  atlas
```

When spright is called without [command line](#command-line-arguments) arguments, the [input definition](#input-definition) is read from `spright.conf` and it writes a `spright.json` file containing the [output description](#output-description).

Passing the argument **-c** runs the completion, which extends `spright.conf` with automatically deduced information:

```perl
input "Decorations (32x32).png"
  grid 32 32
    sprite
    sprite
    sprite
    sprite
    sprite
  row 1
    sprite
    sprite
    sprite
    sprite
    sprite
...
```

It detected that `Decorations (32x32).png` contains five sprites per row and added them below...\
For sheets without grids it adds the sprites' rectangles:

```perl
...
input "misc_scenery.png"
  atlas
  sprite
    rect 78 12 6 27
  sprite
    rect 88 12 4 24
  sprite
    rect 97 9 6 34
  sprite
    rect 107 8 7 40
  sprite
    rect 6 17 17 52
...
```

Now you can complete the definition manually by e.g. giving the sprites IDs and customizing their pivot points:

```perl
...
input "Decorations (32x32).png"
  grid 32 32
  pivot left top
    sprite "banner_top"
    sprite "platform_1_left"
    sprite "platform_1_middle"
    sprite "platform_1_right"
    sprite "platform_1_sole"
  row 2
    sprite "banner_middle"
    sprite "platform_2_left"
    sprite "platform_2_middle"
    sprite "platform_2_right"
    sprite "platform_2_sole"
  row 3
    sprite "banner_bottom_1"
...
```

You can also tag sprites to define animations or other game specific properties and leave sprites you do not want to directly address without ID:

```perl
...
input "Old enemies 2.png"
  grid 16 16
    tag anim "blue_enemy_idle"
    sprite
    sprite
    tag anim "blue_enemy_dead"
    sprite
    tag anim "blue_enemy_jump"
    sprite
  row 1
    tag anim "blue_enemy_run"
    sprite
    sprite
    sprite
    sprite
    sprite
    sprite
  row 2
...
```

See the [output template engine](#output-template-engine) section on how to generate a file consumable by your game engine.

## Terminology

Since there are quite some terms, an explanation of what they represent in __spright__ might be useful:

- __sheet__: a collection of _sprites_ which should be arranged on one or more _slices_, while obeying the defined constraints. Each _sprite_ is part of a single sheet (there is a default sheet _"spright"_).
- __slice__: a single layer of a _sheet_ where the _sprites_ are arranged.
- __sprite bounds__: the rectangular space a _sprite_ allocates on the _slice_.
- __pivot point__: the coordinate of a point on a _sprite_ used for placing it in the game (a.k.a _anchor_).
- __input__: a filename or sequence referring to one or more input images.
- __source__: a single image file of an _input_ containing the pixel data of one or more _sprites_.
- __output__: a filename or sequence referring to one or more output images.
- __texture__: a single image file of an _output_ containing the pixel data of one _slice_, possibly with some output transformations applied.
- __(output) description__: a file generated by spright containing the information about the _sprites_, like where to find them on which _texture_.

## Input definition

Indentation is relevant in the hierarchical input definition file. There are two scoping rules:

1. A definition affects succeeding items on the same or a sub-level.
2. A definition affects its parent item.

The comments in the following sample should exemplify these:

```perl
pivot center middle      # sets default pivot point

input "furniture.png"
  pivot center bottom    # sets pivot point within "furniture.png"
  sprite "chair"
  sprite "lamp"
    pivot center top     # sets pivot point of "lamp"
  sprite "bed"

input "characters.png"
  sprite "player"
  sprite "bird"
    pivot center bottom  # sets pivot point of "bird"
  sprite "wolf"          # "wolf" still gets the default pivot point
```

### Definition reference

The following table contains a list of all definitions, with the item each affects, the expected arguments and a description. Optional arguments are enclosed in square brackets. Unless specified otherwise, optional booleans default to _true_, numbers default to _1_, and an additional value defaults to the first value.

<a id="definition-reference-begin"></a>

| pack | sheet | pack-method | Sets the method, which is used for placing the sprites on the sheet:<br/>- _binpack_ : Tries to reduce the sheet size, while keeping the sprites' trimmed rectangle apart (default).<br/>- _compact_ : Tries to reduce the sheet size, while keeping the sprites' convex outlines apart.<br/>- _rows_ : Layout sprites in simple rows.<br/>- _columns_ : Layout sprites in simple columns.<br/>- _single_ : Put each sprite on its own slice.<br/>- _origin_ : Place all sprites in the top-left corner (use _align_ to position).<br/>- _layers_ : Like _origin_ but also activates layered output of .gif files.<br/>- _keep_ : Keep sprite at same position as in source. |
| width | sheet | width | Sets a fixed sheet width. |
| height | sheet | height | Sets a fixed sheet height. |
| max-width | sheet | width | Sets a maximum sheet width. |
| max-height | sheet | height | Sets a maximum sheet height. |
| power-of-two | sheet | [boolean] | Restricts the sheet's size to be a power of two. |
| square | sheet | [boolean] | Restricts the sheet's size to be square. |
| divisible-width | sheet | pixels | Restricts the sheet's width to be divisible by a certain number of _pixels_. |
| allow-rotate | sheet | [boolean] | Allows to rotate sprites clockwise by 90 degrees for improved packing efficiency. |
| padding | sheet | [pixels], [pixels] | Sets the space between two sprites / the space between a sprite and the sheets's border. |
| duplicates | sheet | dedupe-mode | Sets how identical sprites should be processed:<br/>- _keep_ : Disable duplicate detection (default).<br/>- _share_ : Identical sprites should share pixels on the sheet.<br/>- _drop_ : Duplicates should be dropped. |
| **output** | sheet | path | Adds a new output file at _path_ to a sheet. It can define a single file or a sequence of files (e.g. `"sheet{0-}.png"`). See a list of available [variables](#variables). The file format is deduced from the extension (supported are PNG, GIF, TGA, BMP). |
| debug | output | [boolean] | Draw sprite boundaries and pivot points on output. |
| maps | input,<br/>output | suffix+ | Specifies the number of maps and their filename suffixes (e.g. "-diffuse", "-normals", ...). Only the first map is considered when packing, others get identical _rects_. |
| alpha | output | alpha-mode,<br/>[color] | Sets an operation depending on the pixels' alpha values:<br/>- _keep_ : Keep source color and alpha.<br/>- _opaque_ : Makes all pixels opaque.<br/>- _clear_ : Replace fully transparent pixels with the specified _color_ (defaults to black).<br/>- _bleed_ : Set color of fully transparent pixels to their nearest non-fully transparent pixel's color.<br/>- _premultiply_ : Premultiply colors with alpha values.<br/>- _colorkey_ : Replace fully transparent pixels with the specified _color_ and make all others opaque. |

| **input** | - | path | Adds a new input file at _path_. It can define a single file or an un-/bounded sequence of files (e.g. `"frames{0-}.png", "frames{0001-0013}.png"`). |
| path | input | path | A _path_ which should be prepended to the input's path. |
| colorkey | input | [color] | Specifies that the input has a color, which should be considered transparent (in hex notation e.g. `FF00FF`). |
| grid | input | x, [y] | Specifies that the input contains multiple sprites, arranged in a grid of a certain cell size. In this mode the _rect_ of each _sprite_ is deduced from the grid. Each _sprite_ automatically advances the current cell horizontally. One dimension is allowed to be _0_, so it is automatically set to the source width/height. |
| grid-cells | input | x, y | As _grid_, but specifies the number of cells instead of their size. When the cells are squares, one dimension is allowed to be _0_, so it is automatically deduced. |
| grid-offset | input | x, [y],<br/>[r-x], [b-y] | Offsets the grid from the top-left corner by a number of pixels. Optionally the grid's offset from the bottom-right corner can also be specified, which is used when deducing the cell-size using _grid-cells_. |
| grid-spacing | input | x, [y] | Sets a spacing between the grid cells. |
| row | input | row | Sets a sprite's row within a grid (starting with 0). |
| skip | input | [count] | Skips one or more horizontal grid cells or indices in file sequences (a non-numeric parameter is treated as 1, to allow simple substitution of _sprite "id"_). |
| atlas | input | [pixels] | Specifies that the input contains multiple unaligned sprites, separated by more than a specific number of transparent pixel rows. |
| max-sprites | input | count | Limits the number of sprites to prevent editors from becoming unresponsive on invalid input (default is 1000). |

| duplicate | sprite | [id],<br/>[duplicate-id] | Adds a new sprite which is a duplicate on af existing sprite and optionally set its id. Unless the sprite to duplicate is specified with the second parameter, the last added sprite is duplicated. |
| span | sprite | columns, rows | Sets the number of grid cells a sprite spans. |
| rect | sprite | x, y, width, height | Sets a sprite's rectangle in the input sheet. |
| pivot | sprite | pivot-x, pivot-y | Sets the coordinates of the sprite's pivot point. Optionally the horizontal (_left, center, right_) and vertical (_top, middle, bottom_) origin of the coordinates can be set (e.g. `10, 20` / `right - 5, top + 3` / `bottom left`). |
| trim | sprite | trim-mode | Sets a mode for trimming, which reduces the sprite to the non-transparent region:<br/>- _none_ : Do not trim.<br/>- _rect_ : Trim to rectangular region (default).<br/>- _convex_ : Trim to convex region (_vertices_ are set in output description). |
| trim-channel | sprite | channel | Sets the channel which should be considered during trimming:<br/>- _alpha_ : The alpha channel of a pixel (default).<br/>- _gray_ : The gray level of the pixel. |
| trim-threshold | sprite | value | Sets the value which should be considered non-transparent during trimming (1 - 255). |
| trim-margin | sprite | [pixels] | Sets a number of transparent pixel rows around the sprite, which should not be removed by trimming. |
| crop | sprite | [boolean] | Sets whether the sprite's rectangle should be reduced to the trimmed bounds. |
| crop-pivot | sprite | [boolean] | Sets whether the sprite's pivot point should be relative to the trimmed bounds. |
| extrude | sprite | [pixels],<br/>[wrap-mode] | Adds a padding around the sprite and fills it depending on the _wrap-mode_ :<br/>- _clamp_ : Clamp to border pixels (default).<br/>- _mirror_ : Mirror border pixels.<br/>- _repeat_ : Repeat border pixels. |
| min-bounds | sprite | x, [y] | Sets a sprite's minimum bounds, which is the total space it allocates on the sheet. Smaller sprites are surrounded with transparency. |
| divisible-bounds | sprite | x, [y] | Restricts the sprite's bounds to be divisible by a certain number of pixels. |
| common-bounds | sprite | [key] | Makes all sprites with identical _keys_ expand to common bounds. |
| align | sprite | align-x, align-y | Sets the alignment of the sprite within its bounds. The parametrization works as for _pivot_ points. |
| align-pivot | sprite | [key] | Aligns all sprites with identical _keys_, so their pivot points have identical offsets within the sprites' bounds. |
| tag | sprite | key, [value] | Adds a tag to a sprite (_value_ defaults to an empty string). See list of available [variables](#variables). |
| data | sprite | key, value | Adds a user defined data entry to a sprite. |
| **transform** | sprite,<br/>output | id | Defines a transformation or applies it to sprites and outputs. |
| resize | transform | scale,<br/>[scale-filter] | Sets a factor the image should be scaled by, with an optional explicit scale-filter:<br/>- _box_ : A trapezoid with 1-pixel wide ramps.<br/>- _triangle_ : A triangle function (same as bilinear texture filtering).<br/>- _cubicspline_ : A cubic b-spline (gaussian-esque).<br/>- _catmullrom_ : An interpolating cubic spline.<br/>- _mitchell_ : Mitchell-Netrevalli filter with B=1/3, C=1/3.<br/>- _pointsample_ : Simple point sampling. |

| **description** | - | filename | Adds an additional location where the output description should be written. When the _filename_ is a sequence e.g. `"slice{0-}.plist"` then each _slice_ is output to a separate file. |
| template | description | filename | Sets the template which should be used for generating the output description. |
| set | - | key, value | Sets a variable value, which can be accessed in strings and templates using `{{key}}`. See a list of existing [variables](#variables). |
| group | - | - | Can be used for opening a new scope, to limit for example the effect of a tag. |

### Variables

Beside variables defined by `set` the following variables can be accessed in string parameters using `{{variable}}`:

#### In _sprite_ definitions:
- `index` - the _sprite`s_ index.
- `inputIndex` - the _input`s_ index.
- `inputSpriteIndex` - the _sprite's_ index in the _input_.
- `sheet.id` - the _sheet_ id.
- `source.filename` - the _source_ filename (e.g. `"dir/file 01.png"`).
- `source.filenameBase` - the _source_ filename without extension (e.g. `"dir/file 01"`).
- `source.filenameStem` - the _source_ filename without directory and extension (e.g. `"file 01"`).
- `source.filenameId` - the _source_ filename without extension and special characters replaced by '_' (e.g. `"dir_file_01"`).
- `source.dirname` - the directory part of the _source_ filename (e.g. `"dir"`).

#### In _output_ definitions:
- `index` - the _output`s_ index.
- `sheet.id` - the _sheet`s_ id.
- `sprite.id` - the first _sprite's_ id.

The variables are substituted _before_ the description is output.
Custom transformations can be applied afterwards using the [template engine functions](#additional-functions).

## Output description

By default a [JSON](https://www.json.org) file containing all the information about the sprites is written to `spright.json`. It has the following structure:

```json
{
  "sprites": [
    {
      "id": "sprite_0",
      "index": 0,
      "inputIndex": 0,
      "inputSpriteIndex": 0,
      "pivot": { "x": 8.0, "y": 8.0 },
      "rect": { "x": 0, "y": 0, "w": 16, "h": 16 },
      "trimmedRect": { "x": 0, "y": 0, "w": 16, "h": 16 },
      "rotated": false,
      "sourceIndex": 0,
      "sourceRect": { "x": 0, "y": 0, "w": 16, "h": 16 },
      "trimmedSourceRect": { "x": 0, "y": 0, "w": 16, "h": 16 },
      "sliceIndex": 0,
      "sliceSpriteIndex": 0,

      "tags": { "key": "value" },
      "vertices": [ 0.0, 0.0,  16.0, 0.0,  16.0, 16.0,  0.0, 16.0 ]
    }
  ],
  "slices": [
    {
      "spriteIndices": [0]
    }
  ],
  "sources": [
    {
      "filename": "dir/source.png",
      "path": "root",
      "width": 256,
      "height": 256,
    }
  ],
  "inputs": [
    {
      "filename": "dir/source.png",
      "sources": [
        {
          "index": 0,
          "spriteIndices": [0]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "tags": {
    "key": {
      "value": [0]
    }
  },
  "textures": [
    {
      "sliceIndex": 0,
      "spriteIndices": [0],
      "path": "root",
      "filename": "dir/spright-0.png",
      "width": 256,
      "height": 256,
      "scale": 1.0,
      "map": ""
    }
  ]
}
```

This [spright.json](docs/spright.json) was generated from the [sample](#advanced-usage-example) above. As you can see, it is very verbose and only intended as an intermediate file, which should be transformed using the [template engine](#output-template-engine).

## Output template engine

With the power of the [inja](https://github.com/pantor/inja/) template engine it should be possible to transform the [output description](#output-description) to a text file consumable by your game engine.\
A template is selected with the **-t** or **--template** and the output filename with the **-o** or **--output** parameter:

```
spright -t cpp.inja -o spright.h
```

This is what a simple template, that transforms the IDs of the output description's sprites into a JavaScript array initialization, looks like:

```php
let sprite_ids = [
{% for sprite in sprites %}
"{{ sprite.id }}",
{% endfor %}
];
```

For information about the functionality of the template engine, please see the [inja reference](https://pantor.github.io/inja/) and the provided templates:

#### Additional functions

Beside the functions [provided by inja](https://pantor.github.io/inja/) the following functions are available:

- `ceil(number)`: Returns the lowest integer which is bigger or equal than the passed number.
- `floor(number)`: Returns the biggest integer which is less or equal than the passed number.
- `makeId(string)`: Returns the string with all special characters replaced by `_`.
- `removeExtension(filename)`: Returns the filename without the extension.
- `removeDirectories(filename, [keep])`: Returns the filename without the directories, with an optional number of directories to keep.
- `joinPaths(path, ...)`: Returns a filename by joining the passed paths with directory separators.
- `base64(filename)`: Returns the [base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) encoded content of the file.

### Templates

The following templates are already available:

| Target                                            | Template                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| C++                                               | [cpp.inja](templates/cpp.inja)         |
| [Cocos2d-x](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x) | [cocos2dx.inja](templates/cocos2dx.inja) |
| [Phaser 3](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser) | [phaser.inja](templates/phaser.inja)   |
| [Phaser 2](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser) | [phaser2.inja](templates/phaser2.inja) |
| [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/)                     | [pixijs.inja](templates/pixijs.inja) |

Please share templates you come up with in the [Discussions](https://github.com/houmain/spright/discussions/categories/show-and-tell) section.

The C++ template is just an example for how the sprite description can be directly embedded in code. This [spright.h](docs/spright.h) was generated from the [sample](#advanced-usage-example), using the [cpp.inja](templates/cpp.inja) template.

## Command line arguments
